- **Columns**: Left, center, and right columns  
- **Diagonals**: Both diagonal directions

### Computer AI Strategy
When playing against the computer, the AI follows this priority:
1. **Win**: If the computer can win in one move, it will
2. **Block**: If the player can win in one move, the computer will block
3. **Strategic Placement**: Prefers center, then corners, then edges
4. **Random**: If no strategic move is available, makes a random move
